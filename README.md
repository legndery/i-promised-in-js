# i-promised-in-js
Experimenting with Promises and Generators

# Motivation
Understanding the Difference between Anonymous Callback, Named Callbacks, Promises, Promises with generators and Async/Await methods

#Technologies Used
* Javascript with ES6 Features and Vanilla templating
* jQuery
* Babel Standalone and Babel Polyfill for generator functions
* Bootstrap
* PrettifyJS
* BluebirdJS for Promise Coroutine( Alternative co, q)

#Design Patterns Used
* `Object Literal Pattern`
* `Revealing Module Pattern`
